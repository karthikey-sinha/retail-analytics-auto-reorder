# Project Title

**Intelligent Retail Sales & Inventory Analytics System**


#  Short Description / Purpose

An end-to-end retail analytics project that simulates a real-world Superstore Management System using synthetic data generation and advanced Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).

The project integrates automated inventory reordering logic with sales and profitability analysis to replicate how modern retail businesses monitor performance and optimize operations.


#  Tech Stack

* **Python**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib**
* **Seaborn**
* **Faker (Synthetic Data Generation)**
* **Jupyter Notebook**
* **Power BI (for dashboard visualization – optional layer)**


#  Data Source

The dataset is **custom-generated using Python (Faker library)** instead of using publicly available datasets.

* 1000 transaction records
* 25 structured business columns
* Includes sales, profit, customer segmentation, geography, supplier data, and inventory metrics
* Covers a 2-year simulated transaction timeline

This approach demonstrates data modeling capability rather than only analysis skills.



#  Features / Highlights

✔ Custom retail dataset generation (no Kaggle dependency)
✔ Multi-category retail structure (Furniture, Electronics, Grocery, Office Supplies)
✔ Region-based performance tracking (North, South, East, West)
✔ Customer segmentation analysis (Consumer, Corporate, Home Office)
✔ Profit & discount impact evaluation
✔ Automated inventory threshold logic
✔ Supplier and logistics tracking
✔ Ready-to-integrate dashboard layer

###  Smart Auto-Reorder Logic

If stock falls below threshold (<10 units), the system automatically triggers a reorder flag and assigns a reorder quantity — simulating ERP-style inventory automation.



# Business Problem

Retail businesses often struggle with:

* Overstocking or stockouts
* Poor visibility into regional performance
* Discount strategies reducing profitability
* Lack of integration between sales data and inventory control

Without structured analysis, decision-making becomes reactive instead of data-driven.



#  Goal of the Dashboard

The dashboard aims to provide:

* Region-wise sales & profit visibility
* Category performance comparison
* Customer segment contribution analysis
* Discount vs Profit impact tracking
* Real-time identification of low-stock items
* Payment behavior distribution

It enables management to move from operational reporting to strategic optimization.



#  Business Impacts and Insights

📌 Identifies highest revenue-generating regions
📌 Highlights most profitable product categories
📌 Detects margin erosion due to discount patterns
📌 Enables proactive inventory replenishment
📌 Improves supplier coordination visibility
📌 Supports data-driven retail expansion decisions



### Why This Project Stands Out

Unlike standard EDA projects that analyze static public datasets, this project:

* Builds the data layer from scratch
* Applies real business rules
* Integrates operations + analytics
* Demonstrates ownership of the full analytics lifecycle
